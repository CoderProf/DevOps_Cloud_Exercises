Your team has a AzureDevops(https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops) Repo .

In this repo the devlopers check in T-SQL DB scripts that create and modify tables.

Your company has SQL Server running in Azure VMs in three enviornemnst: Dev, Test and Prod

You need to create a release pipeline that will run the DB scripts in these three enviornements

When a Developer  merges a PR with new/updated DB scripts , the relese pipline will auto-trigger and run the DB Scripts in Dev DB first, then Test DB and Then Prod DB

Verify that the Databases are refelecting the chnages as per the DB Scripts.
